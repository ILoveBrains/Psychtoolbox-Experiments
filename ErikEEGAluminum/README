These are a few functions to help run Psychtoolbox experiments. Nothing to complex, just simplifying what has to be written.

Compilation 0.1 (4/13/17)
	I/O - See their readme
		Input and output codes made at USD (http://apps.usd.edu/coglab/psyc770/IO64.html) to make input and output from matlab faster and more reliable

	actiTrigger
		Send Trigger to the actichamp EEG system and clear it in one function using the Port I/O function

	rightWrongRespAdmin
		Made to supliment the administration of experimenter presented tasks, to help code
